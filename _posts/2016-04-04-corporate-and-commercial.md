At KP we have an exceptionally wide and deep reservoir of corporate and commercial law capabilities. All partners have broad experience in contentious and non-contentious corporate and commercial law matters, ranging from the ordinary operational support to the structuring of groups, cross-border group finance, asset acquisition and cash management structures, and complex corporate litigation.

We regularly act for creditors, buyers and new finance providers in corporate transactions supportive of financing and refinancing, in and out of formal proceedings, and our corporate team members have notable track records in large privatization projects implemented through company and corporate law methodologies.

We have particular experience with cross-border distribution and supply chain, and combine competition and litigation capabilities, to deliver robust and innovative solutions, whether devising a transactional structure, or litigating a distribution dispute.
