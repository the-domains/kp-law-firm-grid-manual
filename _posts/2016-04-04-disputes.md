We take pride in the depth, breadth and track record of our disputes practice, encompassing domestic and cross-border litigation and arbitration, discovery, asset tracing and recovery, strategic planning and dispute risk management, in a wide array of sectors, industries, and one-time, non-recurring, dispute circumstances.

We derive our edge from the combination of good black letter law, the rich experience of disputes partners in advocacy before a wide array of courts, tribunals and authorities, commitment to working with leading forensic, industry and subject matter experts, and structured analytical methodology for preparing, documenting, pleading and proving contentious matters.

Our aptitude for bringing core disputes capabilities together instantly and decisively places us at an advantage in circumstances of injunctive and conservatory measures, multiple concurrent proceedings or parties, and cross-border matters.

Finally, our principled and proactive conflicts, independence and anti-corruption policies allow us to take ownership of the disputes entrusted to us and pursue them rigorously to the maximum extent prescribed by law.
