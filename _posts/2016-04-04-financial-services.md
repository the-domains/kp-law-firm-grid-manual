The partners at KP have established track records acting for most types of credit and financial institutions; we have acted for many of the larger global and international investment banks, securities houses, investment, hedge and private equity funds, trustees, custodians and underwriters, insurers and reinsurers, and their directors and officers.

We have a solid understanding of the economics of most financial services sectors and assist clients in a wide array of regulatory, compliance, transactional and contentious matters. We benefit from the strong synergies of our finance, corporate and capital markets practices and have tested and put into practice methodologies for tailor-fitting to a wide gamut of transactions and disputes.
