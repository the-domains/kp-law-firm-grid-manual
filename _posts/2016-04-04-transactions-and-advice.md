Disputes test the resilience and expediency of non-dispute work. For this reason, we place the hard and disciplined methodologies behind our disputes practice at the heart of our transactional and advisory work. We aim to transgress encyclopaedic information on laws and regulations, or the mechanical replication of transactional trends, structures and forms.

We invest time and effort to achieve a deep understanding of our clients' specific business, markets and industries. We work programmatically to integrate into the guidance we provide the potential impact of factors seemingly extrinsic to a legal question or transaction, such as eventual disputes, conflicts of laws or the likelihood and potential impact of reforms, through the prism of the most critical or latest jurisprudence.
