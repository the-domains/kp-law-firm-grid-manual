We are particularly well versed in transactional and contentious matters arising out of distribution networks. We benefit from our capabilities in competition & antitrust, disputes and commercial law, to provide a state-of-the art advisory and transactional service, while our disputes partners have successfully acted for manufacturers, franchisors, warehousing and logistics operators, financiers and insurers of cross border trade.

We approach transactional matters proactively and employ tested and proven methods for reducing the moral hazard inherent in supply chain arrangements in a largely small market with structurally imperfect competition. We frequently accompany transactional work with analytical guidance on the conduct of commercial relationships, thereby minimizing potential adverse impact of commercial conduct on the intended effects of formal contractual arrangements.
