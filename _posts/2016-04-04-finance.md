All of the partners at KP have substantial experience in a wide array of finance transactions, from simple secured and unsecured corporate finance, to highly complex international structures involving multi-class debt, bonds, convertible instruments and cross-border cash pooling arrangements, in transactional, contentious and restructuring settings.

We have a niche sovereign finance practice, and have acted for managers and lead managers of syndicated sovereign bond issues and secondary holders, as well as significant holders of special issue GGBs (pharmaceutical and non-Greek law GGBs).

We have extensive capabilities in the domain of finance litigation and arbitration, as well as enforcement of creditor rights in Greece and abroad, and we strive to develop and employ self-enforcing finance structures, which eliminate or minimize the need to litigate.

We have acted for a number of international and foreign investment banks, private equity investors, hedge and distressed investment funds, and have been involved in some of the most complex cross-border financing and refinancing transactions with a dominant Greek element, by number of parties and stakeholders, creditor classes, overall value and classes of debt.
