The partners at KP have litigated or arbitrated most types of industrial, commercial and financial dispute, both domestically and in the course of complex cross-border proceedings.

We have acted for plaintiffs, defendants and interested third parties, from the private and the public sectors, in most types of proceedings, including domestic and cross-border litigation and arbitration, recognition and enforcement, multi-jurisdiction interim and conservatory measures, discovery proceedings, discovery and deposition, forensic and other expertise, and mediation.

We are frequently retained to act as lead counsel and lead Greek counsel, and to advise global lead counsel, on matters of Greek law and process, as well as to co-formulate strategy in cross-border litigation. We regularly advise multinational groups or entities with cross-border assets or operations on international insolvency litigation strategy and the cross-border enforcement of security interests.

We clear conflicts carefully, and take ownership of the matters we take to court; we work with top-notch professionals to structure and implement crisis management and containment strategies and communications plans; and we strive to mitigate operational disturbance and personal agitation for clients and their directors and officers, by delivering a seamless service along predefined road maps, from inception through completion of disputes.
