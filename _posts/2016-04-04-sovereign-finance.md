We are at the forefront of the law and practice related to the sovereign debt crisis. Partners at KP have established  track records advising managers of general syndicated and special sovereign issues, as well as  large portfolio managers on secondary market transactions.

We have been retained to advise on a wide array of substantive and procedural law aspects of the Hellenic Republic PSI legal framework, including matters related to collective action clauses, default and remedies, domestic and international, and its impact on specific transactions on  the primary and the secondary markets, including the well-known medical bonds swap exercise.

We work programmatically with faculty, institutional investors and lead global counsel to large portfolio managers, to lay down analytical foundations and roadmaps for dealing with large scale problems and crisis-situations caused by concluded and anticipated write-downs of sovereign debt.
