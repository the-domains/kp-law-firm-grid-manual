Our IP practice is at the forefront of industry and legislative developments in the main IP jurisdictions and in Greece, and has a recognised track record in a wide spectrum of consultative, litigious, legislative and enforcement work.

We have acted for many global, regional and national brands, including record companies, publishers, producers and distribution companies, television stations, collecting societies, software companies, advertising companies, the National Audiovisual Archive, airlines, as well as distinguished individual IP holders, including recognised composers, singers, writers, directors, actors and journalists.

We have intimate knowledge of and involvement to the legislative process affecting domestic IP law and security interests over intangibles. One of our partners has served twice on the legislative committee, which produced the main IP statute currently in force, was appointed Special Advisor to the Minister of Justice on IP issues, and has  served the Task Force Committee for fighting piracy, illegal reproduction and distribution of counterfeit products.

We programmatically develop and employ comprehensive methodologies for strategic management of intangibles throughout their life cycle, from inception through to registration, financing, exploitation and protection, domestically and internationally. We draw heavily on our disputes resources to develop licensing models aimed at incorporating local legal, procedural and cultural idiosyncrasies into international best practice scenarios, to ensure efficient and effective enforcement in each relevant jurisdiction. We advise on the enforcement of winning anti-counterfeit strategies and we work closely with leading industry experts for the conduct of state-of-the art due diligence and demanding forensics.
