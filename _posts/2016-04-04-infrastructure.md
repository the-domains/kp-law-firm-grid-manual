At KP we have advised and represented engineering and construction firms and JVs in major road, railway and subway projects and have successfully conducted large value, multi-party and cross-border disputes arising from complex EPC hot and cold industrial, electromechanical and civil works in transportation and heavy industry projects.

Benefiting from the combination of strengths in procurement, finance, corporate and commercial, and construction law, we are well placed to assist principals, financiers, engineering and construction groups and contractors to take a deep-level look at tendering, negotiation, contractual and work progress and documentation and ensure that commercial goals are not prejudiced by the vastness of specifications and factors involved.

We take a hands-on approach to projects in progress and scrutinize periodically and proactively for latent claims and liability, empowering clients to assess instantly and respond efficiently to the contingencies of complex projects.
