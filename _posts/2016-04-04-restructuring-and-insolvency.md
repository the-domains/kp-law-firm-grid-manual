We are at the forefront of international restructuring, distressed investment and insolvency law and finance across sectors and industries. We work programmatically to incorporate the latest global ideas and developments in the laws and finance of insolvency, such as the use of arbitrage opportunities in the bond and secondary distressed debt, and the primary corporate finance markets, for consensual and non-consensual restructuring, into the substantive and procedural arsenal we bring to the service of investors, creditors and turnaround advisers.

Partners at KP have had leading roles in some of the most significant cross-border restructurings over the past decade, and participate actively in the principal global law and practice shaping forums.

We have a deep understanding of the dynamics of contentious and non-contentious restructurings, and have applied principles and structures for cramming down equity and sub-par dissenting debt, to empower corporate actions and priority pre and post-petition funding, while preserving operations, in many usual and unusual stressed and distressed scenarios.

We develop clear and actionable pathways for the use of restructuring and insolvency proceedings in the service of privatization projects, and strategies for the efficient investment in bad financial and non-financial asset portfolios.

We regularly train investment bankers, financiers and international restructuring advisers, into the intricacies of domestic law and process, and participate in professional working groups engaged in the formulation of streamlined distressed investment models.
