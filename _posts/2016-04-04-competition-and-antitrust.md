We treat competition and anti-trust scrutiny as an integral part of most advisory, transactional and disputes work. Our competition & antitrust team regularly advises and represents domestic and multinational corporates from a variety of sectors on vertical agreements, abuse of dominant position, private enforcement, distribution and supply chain structuring and implementation, transaction terms, unfair practices, merger control, interim and conservatory relief, and regulatory investigation.

Drawing on the combination of strong litigation capabilities, solid experience of proceedings before general courts, national regulators and the Hellenic Competition Commission, and solid cross-border transactional experience, we work closely with competition economists and sector experts to deliver responsive and reliable solutions throughout the life-cycle of competition-sensitive issues, from the design of compliant terms and policies, to the implementation of sound risk management policies and the conduct of specific disputes.
