In an increasingly complex regulatory environment governing distribution models and technologies, across multiple platforms and international borders, it makes a difference to engage a well-resourced team that pieces together the high theory and hands-on practice of media, media transactions and related disputes, equipped with strong insights in intellectual property, antitrust and competition law, and groomed to work up from solid finance and disputes foundations.

We regularly act for clients operating in a wide spectrum of media and media operations, from film, print, radio and television to software and online and offline media business services, from advertising and content production to network distribution and technology.

We have a recognized track record acting for private and public TV broadcasters, film and theatrical producers, distributors, publishers, software companies, new media companies, as well as recognized right-holders, in regulator, contractual and disputes matters, which allows us to take pride in truly knowing how the business deals, works and fights.
